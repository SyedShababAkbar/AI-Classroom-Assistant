💬 OpenAI Integration

This app uses OpenAI's GPT to generate assignment guidance.

🔑 Add your OpenAI Key

Instead of hardcoding, we read it from system variables. Set it up:

```bash
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here  # For Windows
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here  # For Linux/macOS
```

Or permanently set it via your system environment variable settings.

✉️ Email Notifications (Optional)

If you want to receive deadline reminders via Gmail:

1. Generate an **App Password** in your Gmail account.
2. In `email_notifier.py`, update:

   * Sender email
   * App password
3. In `config.json`, update:

```json
{
  "receiverEmail": "your-email@gmail.com"
}
```

---

💬 WhatsApp Notifications (Optional)

You can integrate Twilio API for WhatsApp notifications:

Setup Steps:

1. Create account at [https://www.twilio.com/whatsapp](https://www.twilio.com/whatsapp)
2. Verify your WhatsApp number.
3. Get the following:

   * `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
   * `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
   * `TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`
4. Create a Python script (e.g., `whatsapp_notify.py`) using Twilio SDK to send messages.
5. Call this script when deadlines approach or assignments are updated.
